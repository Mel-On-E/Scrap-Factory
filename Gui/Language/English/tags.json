	"DescTier1": "Through the power of deep-learning crypto quantum gene editing nanotechnology we can create drops out of thin air! Studying those drops should help us improve the process (and profits)!",
	"DescTier2": "The humble and reliable Wood, perfect for research purposes! Its versatility allows us to build factories, chairs, and even toothpicks. Just remember, with every tree felled, profits grow while forests...well, they'll always be there, right?",
	"DescTier3": "Ah, Iron, the backbone of industrial progress! With this sturdy metal, we'll forge our way to success. Ignoring a few rusty details, it's amazing how selling iron can iron out financial worries!",
	"DescTier4": "Introducing Uranium, the hidden treasure of our research endeavors! Its unique properties allow us to unlock new realms of energy efficiency and productivity. While some warn about its radioactive properties, we just didn't implement them!",
	"DescTier5": "Move over, Uranium 238, and make way for the more refined Uranium 235! With this precious isotope, we'll unlock the secrets of nuclear energy and watch our profits skyrocket. Research showed that our Uranium mines produce a small amount of it. We've been able to mark them red. It also seems to be (ridiculously) more lightweight.",
	"DescTier6": "Deuterium, the fuel of the future! By harnessing the power of heavy water, we'll create unimaginable wealth. It's a scientific masterpiece, and the fact that it requires a lot of energy to produce is just a minor hiccup. We'll find a way around that... eventually.",
	"DescTier7": "Diamonds are forever, and so are our profits! With these dazzling gems, we'll make a fortune. Just remember, there may be a few ethical concerns about the diamond industry, but hey, who doesn't love shiny objects? Unfortunately our mines produce a lot of other drops, so we might need to filter the diamonds out.",
	"DescTier8": "Neptunium, the mysterious element from the deep sea. It may not have many practical uses, but hey, it sounds impressive, right? Researching this rare material might not bring immediate profits, but it's all about the thrill of the unknown... and a little bit of radioactive excitement!",
	"DescTier9": "Ah, the enchanting Moon Stone! Rumor has it, it grants incredible powers and brings prosperity to those who possess it. Forget about the fact that it's just a shiny rock. With clever marketing and a sprinkle of imagination, our profits will soar to lunar heights!",
	"DescTier10": "Prepare for explosive profits with Antimatter! Sure, it's highly unstable and difficult to handle, but who can resist the allure of harnessing the most powerful substance in the universe? Just make sure to keep those containment fields intact, and everything will be fine.",
	"DescTier11": "Introducing Bouncium, the bouncy material that defies gravity and logic! With its absurd physics, we'll invent never-before-seen contraptions and create a spectacle that attracts customers like moths to a flame. Just try not to bounce too high and lose sight of your profits!",
